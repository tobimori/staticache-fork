# Kirby Staticache Plugin

Static site performance on demand!

This plugin will give you the performance of a static site generator for your regular Kirby installations. Without a huge setup or complex deployment steps, you can run your Kirby site on any server – cheap shared hosting, VPS, you name it – and enable the static cache to get incredible speed on demand. 

With custom ignore rules, you can even mix static and dynamic content. Keep some pages static while others are still served live by Kirby.

The static cache will automatically be flushed whenever content gets updated in the Panel. It's truly the best of both worlds. 

Rough benchmark comparison for our Starterkit home page: 

Without page cache: ~70 ms  
With page cache: ~30 ms   
With static cache: ~10 ms

## Limitations

A statically cached page will prevent any Kirby logic from executing. This means that Kirby can no longer differentiate between visitors and logged-in users. Every request will be served directly by your web server, even if the response would differ based on the cookies or other request headers.

If your site has any logic in controllers, page models, templates, snippets, or plugins that result in different page responses depending on the request, this logic will naturally not be compatible with Staticache.

If only specific pages are affected by this, you can add them to the cache ignore list (see below) and use Staticache for the rest of your site. Otherwise, using Kirby's default page cache will be the better option overall because Kirby will automatically detect which responses can be cached and which caches can be used for the current request.

## Installation

### Download

Download and copy this repository to `/site/plugins/staticache`.

### Composer

```
composer require getkirby/staticache
```

### Git submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/getkirby/staticache.git site/plugins/staticache
```

## Setup

### Cache configuration

**Basic setup:**

Staticache is a cache driver that can be activated for the pages cache:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'static'
    ]
  ]
];
```

**Ignore rules:**

If you want to keep some of your pages dynamic, you can configure ignore rules like for the native pages cache: https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/cache#caching-pages

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'static',
      'ignore' => function ($page) {
        return $page->template()->name() === 'blog';
      }
    ]
  ]
];
```

All pages that are not ignored will automatically be cached on their first visit. Kirby will automatically purge the cache when changes are made in the Panel.

Please note that already cached pages are unaffected by changes to the `ignore` option. Your web server will pick up the already-created files and will not check if the page is cacheable. If you see cached results from ignored pages, please manually clear your cache directory.

Also, note that Kirby's default caching logic applies on top of manually ignored pages. If your template uses any methods that depend on the user session or request headers (e.g. `$kirby->session()`, `csrf()`...), your pages will not be cached.

**Custom cache comment:**

Staticache adds an HTML comment like `<!-- static YYYY-MM-DDT01:02:03+00:00 -->` to the end of every cached HTML file by default. You can override or disable this comment in the cache configuration:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'static',

      // disabled comment
      'comment' => '',

      // OR string value (only for HTML)
      'comment' => '<!-- your custom comment -->',

      // OR a custom closure
      'comment' => fn ($contentType) => $contentType === 'html' ? '<!-- comment -->' : ''
    ]
  ]
];
```

**Custom root:**

The rendered HTML files are stored in the `site/cache/example.com/pages/` folder just like with the native pages cache. The difference is that all paths within this folder match the URL structure of your site. The separate directories for each root URL ensure that links and references in your rendered HTML keep working even in a multi-domain setup.

If you are using a custom web server setup, you can override the cache root like so:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'static',
      'root'   => '/path/to/your/cache/root',
      'prefix' => null
    ]
  ]
];
```

If your site is only served on a single domain, you can disable the root URL prefix like so while keeping the general storage location in the `site/cache` directory:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'static',
      'prefix' => 'pages'
    ]
  ]
];
```

If you use a custom root and/or prefix, please modify the following server configuration examples accordingly.

If your custom root is outside of the server's document root, users have been successful with these solutions:

- Create a symbolic link (symlink) from your custom root to a path inside the document root. Then use the path inside the document root in the server configuration. For this to work, the server needs to be set up to follow symlinks.
- In an Apache setup: Replace the `%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}` variable with the absolute path to your custom root on the server. E.g. `RewriteCond /var/www/yourPath/%{REQUEST_URI}/...`

In any case, please ensure that your web server has read access to the cache files in your custom root, otherwise it will not be able to handle requests with the statically cached files.

### Web server integration

This plugin will automatically generate and store the cache files, however, you will need to configure your web server to pick the files up and prefer them over a dynamic result from PHP.

The configuration depends on your used web server:

**Apache:**

Add the following lines to your Kirby `.htaccess` file, directly after the `RewriteBase` rule.

```
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html [END]

RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI} -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI} [END]
```

**Caddy:**

A simple Caddy config for Staticache may look like this:

```
example.com

root * /path/to/your/site

file_server
php_fastcgi unix//var/run/php-fpm.sock {
  try_files {path} site/cache/{host}/pages/{path}/index.html site/cache/{host}/pages/{path} index.php
}
```

**nginx:**

Standard PHP nginx config will have this location block for all requests:

```
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

Change it to add `/site/cache/$server_addr/pages/$uri/index.html` before the last `/index.php` fallback:

```
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /site/cache/$server_addr/pages/$uri/index.html /site/cache/$server_addr/pages/$uri /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

**PHP loader:**

If you don't have access to the server configuration, you can load the static caches from your Kirby `index.php`. Compared to Kirby's built-in page cache, this avoids having to load Kirby on every request, but all requests are still passed to PHP. This makes this approach slower than the direct integration into the web server but still much faster than the built-in page cache.

To load the static cache files from PHP, please place the following code snippet right at the top (!) of your `index.php` file (directly after the opening `<?php` tag):

```php
(function /* staticache */ () {
  $root = __DIR__ . '/site/cache';

  // only execute Staticache for web requests
  if (php_sapi_name() === 'cli') {
    return;
  }

  // only use cached files for static responses, pass dynamic requests through
  if (in_array($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], ['GET', 'HEAD']) === false) {
    return;
  }

  // check if a cache for this domain exists
  $root .= '/' . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . '/pages';
  if (is_dir($root) !== true) {
    return;
  }

  // determine the exact file to use
  $path = $root . '/' . ltrim($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?? '', '/');
  if (is_file($path . '/index.html') === true) {
    // a HTML representation exists in the cache
    $path = $path . '/index.html';
  } elseif (is_file($path) !== true) {
    // neither a HTML representation nor a custom
    // representation exists in the cache
    return;
  }

  // try to determine the content type from the static file
  if ($mime = @mime_content_type($path)) {
    header("Content-Type: $mime");
  }

  die(file_get_contents($path));
})();
```

If you want to use the PHP loader, we recommend using it together with header support (see below). Storing the headers increases performance by a bit and also gives you more accurate responses.

### Header support

Staticache stores only the response bodies by default. The HTTP status code as well as headers set by your pages are not preserved in this mode. This ensures compatibility with all web servers.

If your web server supports reading headers from the static files, you can enable header support with the `headers` option:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active'  => true,
      'type'    => 'static',
      'headers' => true
    ]
  ]
];
```

You need to adapt your web server configuration accordingly:

**Apache:**

Header support in Apache requires [`mod_asis`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_asis.html). Please ensure that your Apache installation has this module installed and enabled.

Afterwards, add the following block to your `.htaccess` file to make Apache use `mod_asis` for cached files:

```
<Directory "/var/www/your-site/site/cache">
  SetHandler send-as-is
</Directory>
```

**PHP loader:**

Replace the last six lines of the loader function with this code:

```php
  // split the file into headers (before two line breaks) and body
  $file    = file_get_contents($path);
  $divide  = mb_strpos($file, "\n\n");
  $headers = mb_substr($file, 0, $divide);
  $body    = mb_substr($file, $divide + 2);

  foreach (explode("\n", $headers) as $header) {
    if (mb_substr($header, 0, 7) === 'Status:') {
      http_response_code((int)trim(mb_substr($header, 8)));
    } else {
      header($header);
    }
  }

  die($body);
```

### Compression

Staticache can write pre-compressed copies of cached files alongside the originals. This lets your web server serve them directly without runtime compression overhead.

Enable compression with the `compression` option:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active'      => true,
      'type'        => 'static',

      // gzip with default compression level (6)
      'compression' => ['gzip'],

      // OR with explicit compression level (0-9)
      'compression' => ['gzip' => 9]
    ]
  ]
];
```

For each cached file (e.g. `index.html`), a compressed copy (e.g. `index.html.gz`) will be written next to it. The compressed files are automatically cleaned up when the cache is purged.

You will need to configure your web server to prefer the pre-compressed files:

**Apache:**

Replace the Staticache rewrite rules in your `.htaccess` (see above) with gzip-aware variants[^1]:

```
# Serve pre-compressed static cache files
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} gzip
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html.gz -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html.gz [END]

# Fall back to uncompressed static cache
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html [END]

RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI} -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/site/cache/%{SERVER_NAME}/pages/%{REQUEST_URI} [END]

# Serve correct content type/encoding and prevent double compression
RewriteRule \.html\.gz$ - [T=text/html,E=no-gzip:1]

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  <FilesMatch "\.gz$">
    Header append Content-Encoding gzip
    Header append Vary Accept-Encoding
  </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
```

**Caddy:**

Add `precompressed` to your `file_server` directive[^2]. Without arguments, it checks for brotli, zstd, and gzip sidecar files (in that order):

```
example.com

root * /path/to/your/site

file_server {
  precompressed
}
php_fastcgi unix//var/run/php-fpm.sock {
  try_files {path} site/cache/{host}/pages/{path}/index.html site/cache/{host}/pages/{path} index.php
}
```

Caddy will automatically serve pre-compressed files with the correct `Content-Encoding` header.

**nginx:**

```
location / {
  gzip_static on;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /site/cache/$server_addr/pages/$uri/index.html /site/cache/$server_addr/pages/$uri /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

nginx's `gzip_static` module will automatically prefer `.gz` files when available and the client supports gzip[^3].
